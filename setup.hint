ldesc: "The GNU C Library is the standard system C library for all GNU 
systems, and is an important part of what makes up a GNU system.  It 
provides the system API for all programs written in C and C-compatible 
languages such as C++ and Objective C; the runtime facilities of other 
programming languages use the C library to access the underlying 
operating system."
